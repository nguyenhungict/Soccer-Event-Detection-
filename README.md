# Soccer Event Detection from Commentary Transcripts

## Project Overview
An automated system for detecting key soccer events (Goals, Yellow/Red cards, Penalties, Substitutions) from audio commentary transcripts using transformer-based deep learning. The model leverages temporal alignment and imbalanced learning techniques to identify high-impact moments within 90-minute matches.

## Key Features
- **Temporal Alignment Engine**: Synchronized commentary transcripts with ground-truth SoccerNet labels using a 5-second reaction lag window (T+1 to T+6 seconds), accounting for the natural delay in live sports commentary.
- **Class Balancing Strategy**:
  - Applied **Strategic Undersampling** to the "No-Event" majority class, retaining only 15% of background segments to increase the training signal for rare, critical events.
  - Improved dataset balance from 98:2 (Event:No-Event) to approximately 50:50.
- **Fuzzy String Matching**: Developed a robust data loader using Python's `difflib` to reconcile naming inconsistencies between SoccerNet and SoccerNet-Echoes datasets.
- **Transformer Architecture**: Fine-tuned **XLM-RoBERTa-base** for multilingual sequence classification, capitalizing on its pre-training to handle diverse player names and football terminology.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers datasets scikit-learn torch SoccerNet
   ```

## Technology Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Dataset**: SoccerNet-Echoes (500+ match transcripts), SoccerNet Action Spotting v2
- **Training Environment**: Google Colab (Tesla T4 GPU)

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Dataset**: SoccerNet-Echoes audio commentary transcripts aligned with 500+ match event annotations from SoccerNet Action Spotting v2.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**:
  - Implemented a **3-sentence sliding window** approach to provide sufficient contextual information for the transformer.
  - Developed automated transcript-to-event alignment using **Fuzzy String Matching** (cutoff=0.3) to handle metadata discrepancies between datasets.
  - Applied temporal alignment with a 5-second reaction lag (1-6s after event) to sync commentary with ground-truth timestamps.

### 2. Training Strategy
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: 
  - Original distribution: 98% No-Event, 2% Events (extremely imbalanced).
  - Applied aggressive undersampling: retained only 15% of No-Event samples.
  - Final balanced distribution: ~50% Events, ~50% No-Event.
- **Model Architecture**: XLM-RoBERTa-base (278M parameters) with sequence classification head.
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Batch size: 16 | Learning rate: 2e-5  
  - Epochs: 5 | Max sequence length: 160 tokens  
  - Optimizer: AdamW | Weight decay: 0.01
- **Training Duration**: ~2 hours on Tesla T4 GPU (Google Colab).

### 3. Evaluation Results
The model was evaluated on a held-out validation set (20% of total data) representing unseen matches:

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | 87.0% |
| **F1 Macro (All Classes)** | **0.46** |
| **F1 Weighted** | 0.88 |
| Precision (Weighted) | 0.91 |
| Recall (Weighted) | 0.87 |

### Per-Class Performance:

| Event Type | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **No-Event** | 0.96 | 0.90 | 0.93 | 31,767 |
| **Goal** | 0.34 | 0.61 | **0.43** | 709 |
| **Yellow Card** | 0.35 | 0.54 | 0.43 | 861 |
| **Red Card** | 0.32 | 0.52 | 0.40 | 23 |
| **Substitution** | 0.28 | 0.50 | 0.36 | 1,147 |
| **Penalty** | 0.19 | 0.24 | 0.21 | 85 |

**Key Insights**:
- The model achieves **61% recall for Goal detection**, successfully capturing over half of all scoring events from commentary alone.
- High accuracy (87%) is primarily driven by reliable No-Event classification.
- The Macro F1 of 0.46 reflects the significant challenge of rare event detection in highly imbalanced sports data.

## Usage

### Inference on New Match Transcripts
To extract highlights from a match transcript:

```bash
python test_full_match.py
```

This script will:
1. Load a match transcript (JSON format from Whisper ASR).
2. Apply the same 3-sentence windowing and preprocessing.
3. Generate predictions with confidence scores for each event type.
4. Output a JSON file containing event timestamps and labels.

### Post-Processing (Threshold Tuning)
To optimize precision for production deployment:

```bash
python evaluate_result.py
```

By tuning decision thresholds per event class, the system can achieve significantly higher precision (up to 0.67 for Goals).

## Future Work
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Integrate audio features (crowd noise, referee whistles) and video frames (goal net detection, card color recognition) to improve rare event detection.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Deploy the model as a microservice using FastAPI and ONNX Runtime for live match analysis.
- **Expand Language Support**: Fine-tune on multilingual commentary (Spanish, Arabic) to broaden applicability.
